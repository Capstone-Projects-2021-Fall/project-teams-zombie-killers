## Project Abstract
Zombie Killers is a "tower defense" genre of game marketed towards casual gamers who are familiar with the genre, and want a famililar but slightly more challenging and visually unique tower defense game to play in short bursts during their free time. The product design will focus on gameplay mechanics that draw heavy inspiration from newer additions to the tower defense genre, such as Plants vs Zombies, as well as more traditional tower defense games such as the Bloons Tower Defense series, while adding our own unique twist on the genre.

## High Level Requirement
The end product should be a simple mobile game that can be easily picked up by users of all ages, with the easy-to-learn and addictive gameplay that is characteristic of the tower defense genre of mobile games. The end product should feature a core gameplay loop that consists of the user placing "defender" units that will defend against an invading wave of zombie attackers, accumulating resources and strategizing their defense using a variety of defenders, each with their own unique abilities. 

## Conceptual Design
The product is designed to function as a mobile app and will be made available on Android devices, and will be built in the Unity game engine and C#. The game will also support PC and Windows build, as well as deployment as a web game using the Unity WebGL Player.

## Background
Our project is a new addition to the tower defense genre, similar to other mobile games such as Plants vs Zombies or Bloons TD. It should feature simple tap controls, a short gameplay loop, and the level design and progression system characteristic of this genre of mobile games.

## Required Resources
**Hardware:**
- Computer (Windows and Mac)
- Android device (for mobile/tablet testing)

**Software:**
- Unity Personal or Unity Student 
  - Version 2020.3.17f1
- C#
- Visual Studio (comes with Unity download)

**Team Members**
This project would benefit from team members who are interested in designing a simple mobile game, and is a good first hands-on experience with the Unity game engine as well as C# for those who have never touched game development before. Team members who are familiar with C/Java/OOP in general should have a smooth transition to C#, and Unity is very user/developer-friendly with the help of the Unity Inspector. Interest or past experience in mobile app development, as well as interest in the tower defense mobile game in general is a plus. The project would also benefit from team members with skills in art/sound design to generate assets for the game (although this is not strictly necessary!).
