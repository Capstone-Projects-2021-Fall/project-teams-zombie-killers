## Project Abstract
This document proposes an "tower defense" genre of mobile game marketed towards casual gamers who want an easy-to-pick-up and addicting game to play in short bursts during their free time. The product design will focus on simple gameplay mechanics that allow the user to easily and intuitively pick up the game and play for short periods of time, not unlike similar products such as Plants vs Zombies.

## High Level Requirement
The end product should be a simple mobile game that can be easily picked up by users of all ages, with the easy-to-learn and addictive gameplay that is characteristic of the tower defense genre of mobile games. The end product should be monetizable, with gameplay that keeps users coming back and watching ads or spending money on in-app purchases (IAPs) to help them get that next best high score.

## Conceptual Design
The product is designed to be a mobile app and should be made available on both iOS and Android. This game will be built in the Unity game engine and C#.

## Background
Our project is a new addition to the tower defense genre, similar to other mobile games such as Plants vs Zombies or Bloons TD. It should feature simple tap or swipe controls, a short gameplay loop, and the level design and scoring system characteristic of this genre of mobile games.

## Required Resources
**Hardware:**
- Computer (Windows or Mac)
- iPhone (for iOS testing)
- Android phone (for Android testing)

**Software:**
- Unity Personal or Unity Student
- C#
- Visual Studio (comes with Unity download)

**Team Members**
This project would benefit from team members who are interested in designing a simple mobile game, and is a good first hands-on experience with the Unity game engine as well as C# for those who have never touched game development before. Team members who are familiar with C/Java/OOP in general should have a smooth transition to C#, and Unity is very user/developer-friendly with the help of the Unity Inspector. Interest or past experience in mobile app development, as well as interest in the tower defense mobile game in general is a plus. The project would also benefit from team members with skills in art/sound design to generate assets for the game (although this is not strictly necessary!).
